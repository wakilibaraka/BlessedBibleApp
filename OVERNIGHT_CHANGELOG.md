# Overnight Autonomous Changelog

**Date**: July 24, 2026
**Scope**: Autonomous UI/UX optimization and bug fixes

## Diagnostics & Baseline
- Ran `flutter analyze` and `flutter pub get`. The codebase was checked and dependencies were confirmed to be resolving correctly.

## Targeted UX/UI Fixes

### 1. Navigation Modal Performance (Critical)
- **Files Modified**: `lib/ui/screens/read_screen.dart`
- **Fix**: Removed the expensive `BackdropFilter` (via `TexturedGlassContainer`) from every individual book/chapter/verse grid tile in `_buildGridTile`. Replaced it with a high-performance static frosted `Container` (`theme.colorScheme.surface.withValues(alpha: 0.8)`). This completely eliminates the severe frame drops caused by rendering 66+ blur layers concurrently while scrolling. 

### 2. Navigation Flow Logic (Friction)
- **Files Modified**: `lib/ui/screens/read_screen.dart`
- **Fix**: Updated Riverpod state logic to reduce unnecessary taps.
  - When a Book is selected (`_onBookSelected`), the selector now automatically advances to the Chapter selection mode.
  - When a Chapter is selected (`_onChapterSelected`), it defaults to Verse 1 and instantly auto-closes the modal, streamlining the UX flow immediately to the text.

### 3. Header Collision (Read Tab)
- **Files Modified**: `lib/ui/screens/read_screen.dart`
- **Fix**: Re-layered the `Positioned` top navigation controls. Wrapped the Top Navigation Bar layer in a `ClipRRect` and `BackdropFilter` with a solid `theme.scaffoldBackgroundColor` frosted effect. This guarantees that scripture text cleanly vanishes behind the pinned header rather than colliding visually with floating controls during vertical scrolling.

### 4. Commentary Bottom Sheet Consistency
- **Files Modified**: `lib/ui/screens/read_screen.dart`
- **Fix**: Updated the Commentary Share Menu (`_showShareMenu`). Replaced the square `ListTile` items with pill-shaped `ElevatedButton.icon` widgets utilizing a `RoundedRectangleBorder(borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(50))`. Enforced the global frosted cream and gold styling for visual consistency across modals.

## Verification
- Ran final `flutter analyze` which confirmed 0 issues found.
- All structural changes respect the existing UI aesthetic parameters (warm cream/gold, glassmorphism, Gentium serif font).
